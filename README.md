# HVAC Plumbing Pro Connect Project - Development Log

**Last Session Summary (October 15, 2025)**

This log summarizes the development progress and current state of the `hvac-plumbing-pro-connect-new` project.

## Current Status:

1.  **Local Development Environment (Termux):**
    *   Encountered persistent `ENOSPC` (System limit for number of file watchers reached) errors.
    *   Encountered `node-gyp` compilation failures during `eas-cli` installation, specifically related to `dtrace-provider` and Android NDK paths.
    *   **Conclusion:** The Termux environment on the Android device has fundamental limitations (file watcher limits, `node-gyp` compatibility) that make it unsuitable for local development and building of this project.

2.  **EAS Build Attempts (Cloud):**
    *   Initial `eas build` failed due to `npm ci` reporting `package.json` and `package-lock.json` out of sync. This was resolved by running `npm install` locally, committing `package-lock.json`, and pushing to Git.
    *   Encountered `ViroReact requires New Architecture to be enabled` error. `newArchEnabled=true` was already present in `gradle.properties` and `app.json`. An explicit append to `gradle.properties` was made.
    *   Encountered persistent iOS-related prompts (encryption, Apple ID login) during Android-only `eas build --platform android`. This was due to the presence of the `ios` folder and implicit configuration. `eas.json` was modified to explicitly define the `development` profile for Android only.
    *   **Current EAS Build Error:** `Namespace 'hvac pro connect' is not a valid Java package name`. This was fixed by changing `namespace "hvac pro connect"` to `namespace "hvacproconnect"` in `modules/my-module/android/build.gradle`.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Development Environment Shift:** We are moving development to a more stable Linux environment.
2.  **Debian Environment:** The user has a Debian (trixie) environment set up via `proot-distro` in Termux, with Node.js (v24.9.0) and npm (v11.6.0) already installed.
3.  **Action Required:**
    *   Log into the Debian environment: `proot-distro login debian`
    *   Inside Debian, install `eas-cli`: `npm install -g eas-cli`
    *   Navigate to the project directory (which will need to be cloned or copied into the Debian environment).
    *   Run `eas login`.
    *   Trigger the EAS build: `EAS_SKIP_AUTO_FINGERPRINT=1 eas build --profile development --platform android --clear-cache`

## Pending Local Changes:

*   The `ios` folder is still present. It was decided to remove it, but this action was not yet performed.
*   The `android/gradle.properties` file was modified to append `newArchEnabled=true`.
*   The `eas.json` file was modified to explicitly define the `development` profile for Android.
*   The `modules/my-module/android/build.gradle` file was modified to fix the invalid Java package name.

**Note:** Ensure all local changes are committed and pushed to Git before attempting EAS builds from the Debian environment.
